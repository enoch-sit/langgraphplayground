# Docker Setup Script Update

## Changes Made

Updated `dockerSetup.sh` to **run fully automatically** without requiring user input.

## What Changed

### Before (Interactive)

The script asked users 2 questions:

1. **"Found existing containers. Clean up and rebuild? [y/N]:"**
   - User had to type `y` or `n`
   
2. **"Build complete! Start containers now? [Y/n]:"**
   - User had to type `y` or `n`

### After (Automatic)

The script now:

1. **Automatically cleans up** existing containers if found
   - No prompt - just does it
   
2. **Automatically starts** containers after build
   - No prompt - just starts them

## New Behavior

```bash
./dockerSetup.sh
```

**Output:**
```
[INFO] ========================================
[INFO]   LangGraph Playground Docker Setup
[INFO] ========================================

[SUCCESS] Docker is installed
[SUCCESS] Using 'docker compose' (Docker Compose V2)
[SUCCESS] Port 2024 is available

[WARNING] Found existing containers for langgraphplayground
[INFO] Found existing containers. Automatically cleaning up and rebuilding...
[INFO] Starting aggressive Docker cleanup...
[SUCCESS] Docker cleanup completed

[INFO] Building Docker containers...
[SUCCESS] Docker build completed

[INFO] Build complete! Automatically starting containers...
[INFO] Starting Docker containers...
[SUCCESS] Docker containers started

[SUCCESS] ========================================
[SUCCESS]   Setup Complete!
[SUCCESS] ========================================

[INFO] Access your application at:
  http://localhost:2024

[INFO] View logs with:
  docker compose logs -f

[INFO] Stop containers with:
  docker compose down
```

## Benefits

âœ… **Zero interaction** - Script runs start to finish without input  
âœ… **CI/CD friendly** - Can run in automated pipelines  
âœ… **Faster setup** - No waiting for user responses  
âœ… **Consistent behavior** - Always does the same thing  
âœ… **Safer** - Always cleans up old containers before rebuild  

## Use Cases

### Development
```bash
# One command to rebuild everything
./dockerSetup.sh
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# GitHub Actions / GitLab CI
- name: Setup Docker
  run: ./dockerSetup.sh
```

### Quick Testing
```bash
# Make changes, rebuild, test
git pull
./dockerSetup.sh
# App is now running on http://localhost:2024
```

## What Still Requires Manual Action

**None!** The script is fully automated.

However, you can still manually:
- View logs: `docker compose logs -f`
- Stop containers: `docker compose down`
- Restart: `docker compose restart`
- Check status: `docker ps`

## Comparison with dockerSetupFast.sh

Both scripts are now similar, but:

**`dockerSetup.sh`** (this one):
- Aggressive cleanup (removes images, build cache, volumes)
- Builds with `--no-cache` (fresh build)
- More thorough but slower

**`dockerSetupFast.sh`**:
- Minimal cleanup
- Uses build cache (faster builds)
- Quick iteration during development

## Testing

To test the updated script:

```bash
# First run (no existing containers)
./dockerSetup.sh

# Second run (with existing containers)
./dockerSetup.sh
# Should automatically cleanup and rebuild

# Verify containers are running
docker ps | grep langgraphplayground

# Check the app
curl http://localhost:2024/health
```

Expected output:
```json
{"status":"healthy","service":"langgraph-playground"}
```

## Rollback

If you need the old interactive version, the prompts were:

```bash
# Line ~360 (after check_existing_containers)
read -p "$(echo -e ${YELLOW}Found existing containers. Clean up and rebuild? [y/N]:${NC} )" -n 1 -r

# Line ~375 (after build_docker)
read -p "$(echo -e ${GREEN}Build complete! Start containers now? [Y/n]:${NC} )" -n 1 -r
```

## Files Modified

- âœ… `dockerSetup.sh` - Made fully automatic

## Summary

The Docker setup script is now **fully automated** and ready for:
- Development workflows
- CI/CD pipelines  
- Quick testing
- Production deployments

No more manual prompts - just run and go! ðŸš€
