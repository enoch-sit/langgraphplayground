# ✅ HITL Message Logging Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive message logging for the Essay Writer graph! Users can now see **every step of the essay writing process** in the Messages tab, making the HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) workflow transparent and educational.

## What You Asked For

✅ **"see all these steps logged in messages tab"** - Implemented  
✅ **"user will be seeing the . [steps]"** - Each node logs user-friendly messages  
✅ **"implementation with human in the loop with NLP"** - Already exists, now with visible feedback  
✅ **"add debug log as well"** - Added comprehensive backend logging  

## Changes Made

### 1. Essay Writer Graph (`src/agent/essay_writer_graph.py`)

**Added messages field:**
```python
messages: Annotated[List[BaseMessage], operator.add]
```

**Updated 5 nodes to log progress:**
- ✍️ **plan_node** → "📋 Step 1: Planning Complete"
- 🔍 **travel_plan_node** → "🔍 Step 2: Research Complete"
- ✍️ **generation_node** → "✍️ Step 3: Draft Created"
- 🤔 **reflection_node** → "🤔 Step 4: Review & Feedback"
- 🔍 **travel_critique_node** → "🔍 Additional Research"

**Added debug logging:**
```python
logger.info(f"🗺️ [plan_node] Starting planner...")
logger.info(f"✅ [plan_node] Plan created: X chars")
```

### 2. Backend API (`src/agent/webapp.py`)

**Added initial user message:**
```python
"messages": [HumanMessage(content=input.message)]
```

Now the user's request appears as the first message in the Messages tab.
