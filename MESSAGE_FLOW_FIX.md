# Message Flow Fix - Essay Writer Graph

## Problem Identified

After saying "hi" and "go to Hong Kong", no response was displayed in the UI even though the backend was working (200 OK responses in logs).

## Root Cause Analysis

### Backend Logs Show Success:
```
POST /langgraphplayground/runs/invoke HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
GET /langgraphplayground/threads/.../history?limit=10 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK  
GET /langgraphplayground/threads/.../state HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

✅ Backend is running and processing requests  
✅ Graph is executing  
✅ Responses are being returned  

### The Real Issues:

1. **Graph Interruption Not Communicated**
   - Essay Writer graph has `interrupt_before=["planner", "generate", "reflect"]`
   - When HITL is enabled, graph pauses at these nodes
   - Backend returns `status: "interrupted"` with `next: ["planner"]`
   - Frontend handled interrupts but showed NOTHING to the user
   - User had no idea the graph was paused and waiting

2. **Continuing vs Starting New**
   - When graph is interrupted, clicking "Send Message" again should CONTINUE the graph
   - But frontend was treating every message as a NEW graph execution
   - This caused the graph to restart instead of resume

3. **Backend Resume Logic**
   - Backend now checks if state already has a `task`
   - If yes: resumes with `None` input (continue from checkpoint)
   - If no: creates new essay input with the message as task

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Backend Fix (`webapp.py`)

**Updated `/runs/invoke` and `/runs/stream` endpoints:**

```python
# Check if there's existing state
existing_state = agent.get_state(config)

# If there's existing state with a task, continue from checkpoint
if existing_state.values and existing_state.values.get("task"):
    # Continue - use None input to resume graph
    result = agent.invoke(None, config=config)
else:
    # Start new - create essay input
    essay_input = {
        "task": input.message,
        "max_revisions": 2,
        "revision_number": 0,
        # ... other fields
    }
    result = agent.invoke(essay_input, config=config)
```

### 2. Frontend Fix (`App.tsx`)

**A. Show System Message When Interrupted:**

```typescript
if (response.status === 'interrupted') {
  const nextNode = response.next && response.next.length > 0 ? response.next[0] : 'unknown';
  setCurrentNode(nextNode);
  
  // NEW: Tell user what's happening!
  addSystemMessage(`⏸️ Graph paused at node: "${nextNode}". Click "Send Message" again to continue.`);
  
  await loadHistory();
  await loadState();
}
```

**B. Smart Continue vs Start Logic:**

```typescript
// Check if we should continue an interrupted graph or start new
const shouldContinue = stateInfo?.next && stateInfo.next.length > 0;

if (!shouldContinue && !messageInput.trim()) {
  // Need a message to start new graph
  return;
}

if (shouldContinue) {
  // Continuing interrupted graph
  addSystemMessage('▶️ Continuing graph execution...');
} else {
  // Starting new with user message
  setMessages(prev => [...prev, {
    type: 'HumanMessage',
    content: message,
  }]);
}

// Send to backend (empty message when continuing)
const response = await api.invokeAgent({
  thread_id: currentThreadId,
  message: shouldContinue ? '' : message,
  use_hitl: useHITL,
});
```

## How It Works Now

### User Flow:

1. **User types "go to Hong Kong" and clicks Send**
   - Frontend: Sends message to backend
   - Backend: Creates new essay input with task = "go to Hong Kong"
   - Backend: Starts graph execution
   - Graph: Pauses at `planner` node (interrupt_before)
   - Backend: Returns `{status: "interrupted", next: ["planner"]}`
   - Frontend: Shows "⏸️ Graph paused at node: planner. Click Send Message again to continue."

2. **User clicks Send again (or just presses Enter with empty input)**
   - Frontend: Detects `stateInfo.next = ["planner"]` → shouldContinue = true
   - Frontend: Sends empty message to backend
   - Backend: Detects existing task → calls `invoke(None, config)` to resume
   - Graph: Executes `planner` node → creates essay outline
   - Graph: Pauses at `travel_plan` node (next in sequence)
   - Backend: Returns `{status: "interrupted", next: ["travel_plan"]}`
   - Frontend: Shows "⏸️ Graph paused at node: travel_plan. Click Send Message again to continue."

3. **User continues clicking Send**
   - Graph progresses: travel_plan → generate → reflect → travel_critique → generate → END
   - Each time pausing at HITL checkpoints
   - Final: `{status: "completed", result: {draft: "...essay..."}}`

## Visual Feedback

Now users see:
- 💬 **Their messages** in the chat
- 🔄 **System messages** explaining what's happening:
  - "⏸️ Graph paused at node: planner"
  - "▶️ Continuing graph execution..."
- 📊 **Graph visualization** showing current executing node
- 🔍 **State Inspector** showing current state values
- ⏱️ **Checkpoints** in the sidebar

## Testing

### With HITL Enabled (Human-in-the-Loop checkbox ON):
1. Create thread
2. Type "plan a trip to Tokyo"
3. Click Send → Should see "Graph paused at node: planner"
4. Click Send again → Graph continues to next node
5. Keep clicking Send until essay is complete

### With HITL Disabled (checkbox OFF):
1. Create thread
2. Type "plan a trip to Tokyo"
3. Click Send → Graph runs all the way through automatically
4. See final essay in chat

## Files Modified

1. **`src/agent/webapp.py`**
   - Updated `/runs/invoke` endpoint
   - Updated `/runs/stream` endpoint
   - Added state continuation logic

2. **`frontend/src/App.tsx`**
   - Updated `sendMessage()` function
   - Added interrupt status messages
   - Added smart continue vs start logic

## Benefits

✅ Users now understand what's happening  
✅ Graph can be stepped through node-by-node  
✅ No more silent failures or confusion  
✅ Clear visual and textual feedback  
✅ Educational - students can see each node execute
