# UI Guide Improvements - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Context-Aware Button Text** 
The "Send Message" button now changes based on what's happening:

- **No thread**: `🚀 Send Message`
- **Loading**: `⏳ Processing...`
- **Paused at a step**: `▶️ Execute Next Step: "planner"` (shows which node will run)
- **Normal state**: `🚀 Send Message`

This makes it crystal clear what will happen when you click the button!

### 2. **Interactive Guide Message**
A helpful blue guide box appears at the top that explains what to do:

**When starting:**
> 👋 Welcome! Click "New Thread" to start, then type your essay topic (e.g., "Write about artificial intelligence").

**When thread is created:**
> 📝 Type your essay topic below and click "Send Message" to begin the multi-step essay writing process.

**When paused at planner:**
> 📋 The planner will create an outline for your essay. Click "Execute Next Step" to start planning.

**When paused at generate:**
> ✍️ The generator will write the essay draft based on the outline and research. Click "Execute Next Step" to generate.

**When paused at reflect:**
> 🤔 The critic will review the draft and provide feedback. Click "Execute Next Step" to get critique.

**When processing:**
> ⏳ The AI is working on your essay. This may take a moment...

**When complete:**
> ✅ Process complete! Start a new thread for another essay, or explore the Graph Flow and State Inspector tabs.

**Additional HITL info** (when Human-in-the-Loop is enabled and paused):
> **Human-in-the-Loop is ON:** You control each step. Review the output and click "Execute Next Step" to continue.

### 3. **Guide Toggle**
- The guide can be hidden by clicking the ✕ button
- When hidden, a `💡 Show Guide` button appears to bring it back
- The guide persists across the session so you always know what to do

### 4. **Better Placeholder Text**
The textarea placeholder changes contextually:

- **Starting new essay**: `Type your essay topic... (e.g., 'Write about climate change')`
- **Continuing paused workflow**: `(Optional) Add instructions or just click the button to continue...`

This makes it clear that when continuing, you don't need to type anything!

### 5. **Enhanced HITL Toggle Label**
The Human-in-the-Loop checkbox now shows its current mode:
- When **ON**: `Human-in-the-Loop (Manual Control)`
- When **OFF**: `Human-in-the-Loop (Auto Run)`

Plus a tooltip: "When enabled, the process pauses at each major step for your approval"
