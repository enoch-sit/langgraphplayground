# üéì Educational Enhancement Summary

## What We Built

This LangGraph playground has been transformed into a **comprehensive educational platform** for teaching AI agents, state management, and graph execution. Students can now **edit prompts, modify state, and experiment in real-time** to understand how LangGraph works.

---

## ‚ú® New Features for Classroom Use

### 1. **Editable System Prompts** üé®

Students can modify the AI agent's system prompt to change its behavior!

**What changed:**
- System prompts are now stored in **state** (not hardcoded)
- Each thread can have different prompts
- Students can edit, test, and reset prompts

**Educational benefit:**
- Learn prompt engineering by experimentation
- See immediate impact of prompt changes
- Understand how prompts guide AI behavior

**Example experiments:**
- Make agent speak like a pirate üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
- Add emoji usage for friendly responses
- Change tool calling instructions
- Make responses formal or casual

---

### 2. **Adjustable Model Parameters** ‚öôÔ∏è

Students can tweak LLM parameters and observe the effects!

**Editable parameters:**
- **Temperature** (0.0 - 1.0): Controls randomness
  - 0.0 = Completely deterministic
  - 1.0 = Maximum creativity
- **Max Tokens**: Control response length

**Educational benefit:**
- Understand temperature's effect on consistency
- See why tool calling needs low temperature
- Experiment with creativity vs reliability trade-offs

**Example experiments:**
- Set temp to 0.0, ask same question 3 times ‚Üí identical responses
- Set temp to 0.9, ask same question 3 times ‚Üí different responses
- Compare tool calling accuracy at different temperatures

---

### 3. **Comprehensive State Viewing** üîç

See **everything** in the state with detailed descriptions!

**What you can view:**
- All messages (Human, AI, Tool)
- Current prompts
- Model parameters
- Metadata (next nodes, checkpoint IDs)

**Educational benefit:**
- Understand state structure
- See how state changes over time
- Learn what information flows through graph

**API endpoint:**
```
GET /threads/{id}/state/fields

## üîß Technical Implementation

### StateManager Enhancement

**File:** `src/agent/state_manager.py`

**New features:**
```python
# Default prompts stored as constants
DEFAULT_PROMPTS = {
    "agent_system_prompt": "...",
    "tool_execution_message": "..."
}

# Field descriptions for tooltips
FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS = {
    "messages": "The conversation history...",
    "agent_system_prompt": "The system prompt that guides...",
    ...
}

# New methods:
- get_prompt(prompt_name)
- update_prompt(prompt_name, new_prompt)
- reset_prompt_to_default(prompt_name)
- get_all_prompts()
- initialize_prompts_in_state()
```

**Key improvement:** Generic, reusable for any LangGraph

---

### Graph Refactoring

**File:** `src/agent/graph.py`

**Changes:**
```python
# State now includes editable fields
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]
    agent_system_prompt: Optional[str]  # NEW!
    temperature: Optional[float]        # NEW!
    max_tokens: Optional[int]          # NEW!

# call_model now reads from state
def call_model(state: AgentState):
    system_prompt = state.get("agent_system_prompt", SYSTEM_PROMPT)
    temperature = state.get("temperature", 0.1)
    max_tokens = state.get("max_tokens", 4096)
    # ... use these values
```

**Key improvement:** Prompts are runtime-editable, not compile-time fixed

---

### API Endpoints Added

**New routes:**
```
# Prompts
GET    /threads/{id}/prompts
GET    /threads/{id}/prompts/{name}

## üîç Debugging Student Code

### Common Issues

**Problem:** "My prompt changes aren't working"

**Solutions:**
- Check: Did you call `/prompts/initialize` first?
- Check: Are you using the right thread_id?
- Check: Look at `/state/fields` to see actual value

---

**Problem:** "Agent still using old behavior"

**Solutions:**
- Create new thread for clean slate
- Verify prompt actually updated (check API response)
- Clear browser cache if using UI

---

**Problem:** "Can't see my prompts"

**Solutions:**
- Call `POST /threads/{id}/prompts/initialize`
- This adds prompts to state
- Then they become editable

---

## üí° Best Practices for Classroom

### Do's ‚úÖ

- **Start simple:** Basic prompt edits first
- **One change at a time:** Isolate variables
- **Document experiments:** Keep notes on what works
- **Use checkpoints:** Save interesting states
- **Compare results:** Side-by-side testing

### Don'ts ‚ùå

- **Don't skip initialization:** Always init prompts first
- **Don't forget to reset:** Clean slate between experiments
- **Don't edit randomly:** Understand what you're changing
- **Don't ignore errors:** Read error messages carefully
